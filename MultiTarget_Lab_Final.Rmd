# Data Understanding

We will work on Energy Efficiency. More information on the data can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency).

We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

We have these attributes:

The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1...X8) and two responses (or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2). The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. 

Specifically: 
X1	Relative Compactness 
X2	Surface Area 
X3	Wall Area 
X4	Roof Area 
X5	Overall Height 
X6	Orientation 
X7	Glazing Area 
X8	Glazing Area Distribution 
y1	Heating Load 
y2	Cooling Load

# Data Preparation

## Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(keras)
library(readxl)
library(caret)

source("./functions/train_val_test.R")
```

## Data Import

```{r}
# if file does not exist, download it first
file_path <- "./data/energy.xlsx"
if (!file.exists(file_path)) { 
  dir.create("./data")
  url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00242/ENB2012_data.xlsx"
  download.file(url = url, 
                destfile = file_path, 
                mode = "wb")
}

energy_raw <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = file_path)
```

We now have`r nrow(energy_raw)` observations and `r ncol(energy_raw)` variables.

These column names are detected:

```{r}
energy_raw %>% colnames
```
You can see we have eight independent variables and two dependent (target) variables.

```{r}
energy_raw %>% summary
```

All variables are numeric.

## Train / Validation / Test Split

We will use 80 % training data and 20 % validation data.

```{r}
c(train, val, test) %<-% train_val_test_split(df = energy_raw, 
                                              train_ratio = 0.8, 
                                              val_ratio = 0.0, 
                                              test_ratio = 0.2)

```

We check our target variables for training and validation dataset.

```{r}
summary(train$Y1)
summary(test$Y1)

summary(train$Y2)
summary(test$Y2)
```

# Modeling

The data will be transformed to a matrix.

```{r}
X_train <- train %>% 
  select(-Y1, -Y2) %>% 
  as.matrix()
y_train <- train %>% 
  select(Y1, Y2) %>% 
  as.matrix()

X_test <- test %>% 
  select(-Y1, -Y2) %>% 
  as.matrix()
y_test <- test %>% 
  select(Y1, Y2) %>% 
  as.matrix()

dimnames(X_train) <- NULL
dimnames(X_test) <- NULL
```

## Data Scaling

The data is scaled. This is highly recommended, because features can have very different ranges. This can speed up the training process and avoid convergence problems.

```{r}
X_train_scale <- X_train %>% 
  scale()

# apply mean and sd from train dataset to normalize test set
col_mean_train <- attr(X_train_scale, "scaled:center") 
col_sd_train <- attr(X_train_scale, "scaled:scale")

X_test_scale <- X_test %>% 
  scale(center = col_mean_train, 
        scale = col_sd_train)
```


## Initialize Model

```{r}
dnn_reg_model <- keras_model_sequential()
```

## Add Layers

We add two hidden layers and one output layer with two units for prediction.

```{r}
dnn_reg_model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 50, 
              activation = 'relu', 
              input_shape = c(ncol(X_train_scale))) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'relu') %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 2, activation = 'relu')
```

Let's take a look at the model details.

```{r}
dnn_reg_model %>% summary()
```

It is a very small model with only close to 1000 parameters.

## Loss Function, Optimizer, Metric

```{r}
dnn_reg_model %>% compile(optimizer = optimizer_adam(),
                          loss = 'mean_absolute_error')
```

We put all in one function, because we need to run it each time a model should be trained.

```{r}
create_model <- function() {
  dnn_reg_model <- 
      keras_model_sequential() %>% 
      layer_dense(units = 50, 
              activation = 'relu', 
              input_shape = c(ncol(X_train_scale))) %>% 
      layer_dense(units = 50, activation = 'relu') %>% 
      layer_dense(units = 2, activation = 'relu') %>% 
      compile(optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
              loss = 'mean_absolute_error')
}
```


## Model Fitting

We fit the model and stop after 80 epochs. A validation ratio of 20 % is used for evaluating the model.

```{r eval=F}
dnn_reg_model <- create_model()
history <- dnn_reg_model %>% 
  keras::fit(x = X_train_scale, 
             y = y_train,
             epochs = 80, 
             validation_split = 0.2,
             verbose = 0, 
             batch_size = 128)
plot(history,
     smooth = F)
```

There is not much improvement after 40 epochs. We implement an approach, in which training stops if there is no further improvement.

We use a patience parameter for this. It represents the nr of epochs to analyse for possible improvements.

```{r}
# re-create our model for this new run
dnn_reg_model <- create_model()

early_stop <- callback_early_stopping(monitor = "val_loss", patience = 20)

history <- dnn_reg_model %>% 
  keras::fit(x = X_train_scale, 
             y = y_train,
             epochs = 200, 
             validation_split = 0.2,
             verbose = 0, 
             batch_size = 128,
             callbacks = list(early_stop))
plot(history,
     smooth = F)
```

# Model Evaluation

We will create predictions and create plots to show correlation of prediction and actual values.

## Predictions

First, we create predictions, that we then can compare to actual values.

```{r}
y_test_pred <- predict(object = dnn_reg_model, x = X_test_scale)
y_test_pred %>% head
```
We can see that we have two output columns, which refer to our two target variables.

## Check Performance

```{r}
test$Y1_pred <- y_test_pred[, 1]
test$Y2_pred <- y_test_pred[, 2]
```

We create correlation plots for Y1 and Y2.

```{r}
R2_test <- caret::postResample(pred = test$Y1_pred, obs = test$Y1)
g <- ggplot(test, aes(Y1, Y1_pred))
g <- g + geom_point(alpha = .5)
g <- g + annotate(geom = "text", x = 15, y = 30, label = paste("R**2 = ", round(R2_test[2], 3)))
g <- g + labs(x = "Actual Y1", y = "Predicted Y1", title = "Y1 Correlation Plot")
g <- g + geom_smooth(se=F, method = "lm")
g
```

```{r}
R2_test <- caret::postResample(pred = test$Y2_pred, obs = test$Y2)
g <- ggplot(test, aes(Y2, Y2_pred))
g <- g + geom_point(alpha = .5)
g <- g + annotate(geom = "text", x = 15, y = 30, label = paste("R**2 = ", round(R2_test[2], 3)))
g <- g + labs(x = "Actual Y2", y = "Predicted Y2", title = "Y2 Correlation Plot")
g <- g + geom_smooth(se=F, method = "lm")
g
```
